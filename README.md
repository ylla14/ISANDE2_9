Welcome to the Inventory Management System (IMS) of Brady Pharma Inc. We developed an Inventory Management System (IMS) to streamline inventory tracking and organization, providing real-time updates and reports for improved decision-making. 
The system aims to improve efficiency and accuracy in inventory management, reducing stockouts and overstock risks. It connects inventory managers and sales representatives, providing up-to-date data for each department. The system is designed 
to support efficient tasks.
